# DS and Algo assignments


- Reverse a Linked List without using any external space. An additional one or two pointers could be used. For the same Linked List, check if it's a palindrome or not. 

- Given an array of Size n, rearrange the numbers of the array in such a way that even and odd numbers are arranged alternatively in increasing numbers. The numbers need to be arranged in Odd-Even or Even-Odd Pattern, depending on the smallest numbers in the array. 

                 Input: arr[] = {1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 10} Output: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 7    
                 Input: arr[] = {9, 8, 13, 2, 19, 14}   Output: 2, 9, 8, 13, 14, 19

- Merge Two Sorted Arrays. The arrays are of the same lenght. 
     
 Input: [1,3,57], [2,4,6,8]
 Expected Output: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8] 

            What is the time efficiency of the above problem? 


- Sort a Stack S1 using another Stack S2. 

- Given two integer arrays(arr1 and arr2) of equal length, Check if the given arrays are equal or not.


- If you have a 2 GB file with one string per line, which sorting algorithm would you use to sort the file and why

- Write a method to sort an array of strings so that all the anagrams are next to each other.


- You are given two sorted arrays, A and B, and A has a large enough buffer at the end to hold B. Write a method to merge B into A in sorted order.

- In a singly linked list, Insert and Delete a node at Last & First

- Given an array arr of n integer elements, write a program to find the length of the longest subarray with sum equals to 0.

  Example1:
  Input: arr[] = [15, -2, 0, -8, 3, 7, 10, 23]
  Output: 5
  Explanation: The largest subarray with 0 sum is [-2, 0, -8, 3, 7]
