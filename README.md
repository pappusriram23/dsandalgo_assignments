# DS and Algo assignments


# Assignment 1

1. Reverse a Linked List without using any external space. An additional one or two variables could be used. For the same Linked List, check if it's a palindrome or not. 

2. Given an array of Size n, rearrange the numbers of the array in such a way that even and odd numbers are arranged alternatively in increasing numbers. The numbers need to be arranged in Odd-Even or Even-Odd Pattern, depending on the smallest numbers in the array. 

                 Input: arr[] = {1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 10} Output: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 7    
                 Input: arr[] = {9, 8, 13, 2, 19, 14}   Output: 2, 9, 8, 13, 14, 19

3. Merge Two Sorted Arrays. The arrays are of the same length. 
     
 Input: [1,3,57], [2,4,6,8]
 Expected Output: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8] 

 What is the time efficiency of the above problem? 


4. Sort a Stack S1 using another Stack S2. 


# Assignment 2

1. Given two integer arrays(arr1 and arr2) of equal length, Check if the given arrays are equal or not.

2. Give a String Str, Str has a bunch of words. Return the string by reversing word by word. 

Example: 
Input= “ I had breakfast” 
Output =” breakfast I had” 

Input= “Lets go out” 
Output = “out go Lets” 

3. Write a method to sort an array of strings so that all the anagrams are next to each other.

4. You are given two sorted arrays, A and B, and A has a large enough buffer at the end to hold B. Write a method to merge B into A in sorted order.


# Assignment 3

1. Given an array arr of n integer elements, write a program to find the length of the longest subarray with sum equals to 0.

  Example1:
  Input: arr[] = [15, -2, 0, -8, 3, 7, 10, 23]
  Output: 5
  Explanation: The largest subarray with 0 sum is [-2, 0, -8, 3, 7]
  
2. If you have a 2 GB file with one string per line, which sorting algorithm would you use to sort the file and why
  
3. Given a String Str, Find the longest substring in Str.  {Incase of a conflict, return the string that occurs first} 

Example
Input: aaaabaaa
Output: aaabaaa

Input: racecar and kayak
Output: racecar


  # Assignment 4
  
  1. In a singly linked list, Insert and Delete a node at Last & First
  
  2. Given a list of non negative integers, arrange them such that they are sorted in descending order. No external sorting functions can be used. 
    Example:
    Input: {4,3,1,2,5}
    Output:{5,4,3,2,1} 
   
  3. Given a Binary Search Tree T, print the values of the tree in ascending order.
  
  4. Given a set of positive integers, find all its subsets. The set can contain duplicate elements, so any repeated subset should be considered only once in the output.
   Example:
   Input: S = {1, 2, 2}
    Output: {}, {1}, {2}, {1, 2}, {2, 2}, {1, 2, 2}
